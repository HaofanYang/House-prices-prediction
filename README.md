# House-prices-prediction

**I obtained some important features (e.g. number of rooms) and descriptive statistics about the dataset. **

**The data was then split into testing and training subsets (20:80 ratio) and a suitable performance metric for this problem was determined. **

**I picked an optimal model by analyzing performance graphs for the decision tree algorithm with varying parameters (such as maximum depth) and training set sizes.** 

**Although it was somewhat intuitive to capture optimal parameters on learning curves by observing tendencies, I still used GridSearchCV to justify the choice of those parameters. **

**Finally, I tested this model on a new sample and compared the predicted selling price to my statistics, obtaining the coefficient of determination (R2) at 0.82. **

**My work was reviewed by project organizers and I was successfully awarded a Nanodegree in Machine Learning. **
